```

## 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key
- See requirements.txt for complete package list

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Input Processing Agent**
   - Analyzes user intent
   - Determines required prompt structure
   - Validates input requirements

2. **Prompt Generation Agent**
   - Creates structured prompts
   - Implements XML tagging
   - Ensures format consistency

## 📊 Usage Example

1. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
2. Input your prompt intention (e.g., "write an article")
3. Optionally add examples
4. Click "Generate Prompt"
5. Watch as the system generates a structured prompt
6. Download the generated prompt as needed
